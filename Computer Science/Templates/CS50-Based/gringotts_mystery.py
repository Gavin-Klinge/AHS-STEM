    Assignment Directions:
    Background:
    You've just arrived at Gringotts Wizarding Bank with Hagrid, and you're about to enter the vault 
    that once stored the most precious magical object in the wizarding world â€” the Philosopherâ€™s Stone. 
    But first, the goblin demands that you recall the number of the vault where it was kept. 
    Your answer must be precise â€” or you'll be denied access.

    Your Task:
    Write a Python program that asks the user for the number of the vault that held the Philosopherâ€™s Stone. 
    If the user correctly inputs 713 or types out a variation like "seven thirteen", "seven-one-three", or 
    "seven one three" (case-insensitive), the program should respond with:
    Congratulations! You have access to the vault.
    For any other response, it should output:
    Nope! Try again.
    ðŸ§  Hints:
    You can check for string equality without converting input to an integer.
    Use .strip().lower() to ignore surrounding spaces and case differences.
