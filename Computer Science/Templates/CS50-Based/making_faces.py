Assignment Directions:
Before there were emoji, there were emoticons. In this assignment, you'll write a program that:
- Implements a function named convert that:
  - Accepts a string as input.
  - Replaces any occurrence of ":)" with "🙂" (a slightly smiling face).
  - Replaces any occurrence of ":(" with "🙁" (a slightly frowning face).
  - Returns the updated string.
- Implements a function named main that:
  - Prompts the user for input.
  - Calls the convert function on the input.
  - Prints the result.
- Calls the main function at the bottom of the file.
Hints:
- The input() function returns a string.
- You may use string methods such as .replace() to perform the substitutions.
- Emojis can be used like any character enclosed in quotes, for example "🙂".
