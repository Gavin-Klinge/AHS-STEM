### Assignment Directions ###
''' Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, 
    and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, 
    or even by having them pause between words.
    In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python 
    that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, 
    replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
    For example, if the user enters "I am a slow speaker",
    the program should output "I...am...a...slow...speaker".

    Hints
    Recall that input returns a str, per: docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.
    Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, 
    per: docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.

    You can use the str.split method to split a string into a list of substrings.
    You can use the str.replace method to replace all occurrences of a substring
    with another substring.
    You can use the str.join method to join a list of strings into a single string.
    You can use the str.strip method to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string.'''
